5,"Best Jet Fight Game Ever!! Good graphics and great controls. The simulation is realistic. You can build an enemy base or units anywhere in the world map. Various modern jets with each unique weapons and characteristic. Thank you Rortos! I definitely love this game! Please add more planes like the SR-71 Blackbird, F117 Nighthawk, B2 Bomber, JAS 39 Gripen, HAL Tejas and J-20 Chengdu. Also I recommend to have an deployable ally ship or plane to have a companion. Also please add more modes!!!"
5,"Please (1) Include YF-23, FAXX, SR-71, F-117 (2) Some pilots only have helmets but lack oxygen mask. Please fix this, guys. (3) 4 vs 4 online multiplayer squadron fight is missing (4) More maneuverability for planes by a new control tool is necessary. Otherwise this game is by far the best game on Google Playstore. Thanks in advance..."
5,Awesome game. Best flight fighter sim by rortos but I could not afford to pay the game. It was free for a while but you've gotta buy a war pack. Very expensive. Bring back the dog fights free and I'll buy the full game and I was an avid player.
5,Best flight/fighter simulator app out there. Just wish you could play normal mode without having to pay for upgrades. Rortos>> Perhaps you could allow the watch video of advertisements options for plane upgrades and allow access to whole game.
5,I really like the game the graphics are unmatched and the game is so fun for all ages beginners can play and experienced players are challenged I just wish I could fly all of the plans but u fortunately I have no money to pay for the game if I could I know it would be worth it ! Thanks AIRFIGHTERS F
5,"I loved this game since I ever installed this, the action, is great... but can you guys keep Extreme Landings/Pro available for android devices down to 4.4.4? Please!!!!!!! This is my only device to install games, I don't have a phone or iPad!!! ??????????"
5,"I like this game but please add more planes like SR-17,su27,su35,su37,su25,saab gripen and all planes."
1,I like this game a lot. But the problem is that when i open the app it just loads and never shows the main menu. It will just show Rortos flight engine written in middle and a rotating thing which shows that it is loading but it never shows up. I even left it for an hour but it just loads and nothing shows up. Please fix it.
1,There used to be a version called air fighters pro that you had to pay for. I purchased it and I loved it. You had access to every plane and you could create your own scenarios for free. Everything was included. Now this game is a far from that. Everything that used to be included in the one time pu
1,Didn't see any instructions on how to keep the jet in the air even in easy mode of the training sessions. There ARE no training tips. I pushed all the buttons on the screen and none of them keep me in the air. They only fire all the guns. THIS training would wipe out the entire squad before war. Not realistic enough. It seems to be just an opportunity to give you a 30 second ad for another similar app every 15 seconds! Will be uninstalling this as it eats up battery like crazy!
1,This app is pretty much pay app. No need playing it unless you buy the full version because in the free version you only get to do the training simulation and that's it.
1,"giving 1 star, wouldve given 0 if i could because 90% of game content is not available to you if you dont buy it. You get 1 jet for free and thats it. you need to unlock/buy dogfight and 99% of world supermacy loactions. So you get 1 mode (training) and 1 jet for free. Rest is pay to play that comprises of 90%+ of content. Sick of it. Devs have written 'Some feature require in app purchases' nope bro. 95% of features require in app purchases."
1,"I like the game in general, but I bought the premium version of it and now after I didn't play the game for an amount of time, I can only play the free version. Very unfair that there is no possibility to restore my purchase. Would appreciate if somebody would help me with that."
